<h1> MOM ARE YOU THERE? </h1>
<p> Three daughters of mother Gaia are standing next to the bed of their mom, contemplating how to wake her up out of her oblivion.

CRYSTAL DUSTED WITCH

Nature=technology
- historicization of the idea of nature 
Science, technology and production simulate the crucial powers of nature.
Suggests different materiality for technology. Draw line with Cronenberg and how non-nature is impermeable surfaces (like technology now). technology should have materiality such as cork and breathing silicone. 
Culture seizes the opportunity to simulate the crucial powers of nature: the power of thought for example, repeated in the computer.
