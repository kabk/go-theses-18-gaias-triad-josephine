CRYSTAL DUSTED WITCH
- technological
- progressive 
- for invasion of technology on the human body
- we are literally embodied by liquid crystal, which are also used for the manufacturing of our screens. We are technology, humans are nature. 
Nature=technology
- historicization of the idea of nature 
Science, technology and production simulate the crucial powers of nature.
Suggests different materiality for technology. Draw line with Cronenberg and how non-nature is impermeable surfaces (like technology now). technology should have materiality such as cork and breathing silicone. 
Culture seizes the opportunity to simulate the crucial powers of nature: the power of thought for example, repeated in the computer.
